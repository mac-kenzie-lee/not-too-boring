# Not Too Boring

Not Too Boring, a curated website helping you determine what to do when the weather changes. Currently featuring San Francisco, Orange County, Los Angeles and Seoul.
I created it while thinking about how it's hard to plan for weather changes when you are trying to enjoy a new place, or just the neighborhood around you on a day off. 
I remember living in Seoul during monsoon season, and would always wonder what would be things I could do on rainy days... in the winter when it was cold, I also wondered what I could do then without suffering too much. This project was created as a way to help guide someone in that sort of situation.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap w/JQuery

Created the website while utilizing bootstrap, and leveraging the bootstrap library to implement various features. 

## Optimizations

Improved the data organization to work for multiple accordions in bootstrap.

## Future Plans for This Project

I would like to implement more locations, include the functionality for user collaboration, as well as connecting weather APIs into the site to give advice dynamically.


## Lessons Learned:

Working with bootstrap was nice, but there were downsides to using the library itself in terms of organization and customizations. Creating classes for the weather types would be more efficient and helpful for future improvements of the code.
